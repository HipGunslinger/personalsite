            <p>Hi there,<br>
            <br>
            My name is Johnny. I was born in Toronto Ontario in the Common Era year of 1980. That's probably the least interesting thing about me though, as it doesn't really explain anything except that I was once in a particular place at a particular time. There are many more slightly interesting things about me, such as the fact that I am a black belt in Shaolin Kung Fu, I'm a trained <em>stage actor</em>, I'm a reasonably talented chef, I know how to juggle pretty well, and I suffer from an undiagnosed auto-immune condition of which the main symptom is <strong>my blood vessels explode and leak blood into tissue almost all over my body</strong> . I've been prescribed a medication that will hopefully control it, but there's still very much we don't know about it, like what has caused it for example. The prescribed medication is chiefly used to treat gout, so on the upside, I have manage to avoid developing gout.</p>

            <p>It's because of this condition that I've been placed on a modified course schedule at BCIT for at least the forseeable future. You can have a look at my course load over on <a href="../misc/courses.html">this page here.</a></p>
